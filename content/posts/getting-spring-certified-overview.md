So I've finally decided that I'm going to get Pivotal's __Spring Certified Professional__ and there's so many and so few resources available at the same time!

<!--more-->

In the past, when I was reviewing certification material,there always seemed to be specific books aimed at helping you pass the certification that were suggested by the course itself or were highly recommended by the community, and with the Spring certification I've found this to not be the case. Pivotal recommends that you take the multi-day course where you are led by an instructor who will review all course material expected to be on the exam. If you have both the money and the time then this could be a very good option as you'll be receiving instruction directly from the team that built out the product.

Regardless of the option you're going to choose, I've chosen to handle 

To begin with, I've really only found one book that deals directly with the certification, and most of the other references are either for older versions of the exam or are behind additional paywalls or programs.

That said, I would be remiss if I failed to mention Ivan Kriszan's excellent Spring Certification review book [Core Spring 5 Certification in Detail](https://www.kobo.com/en/en/ebook/core-spring-5-certification-in-detail). I cannot speak too highly of this book as it goes over in detail each section listed in the Spring study guide
