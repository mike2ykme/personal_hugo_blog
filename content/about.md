## Hi! I'm Micheal,

I'm an IT professional and all around computer enthusiast. I hope you'll find what I've written useful, or at least helpful enough to point you in the right direction. I make no claims this is the highest quality content, but more that it's notes and content based on what I've experienced as well as worked on.
